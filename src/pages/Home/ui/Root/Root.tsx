        Material UI components Every Material UI component available so far.
        Material UI aims to provide building blocks for developers to create
        great user interfaces using the Material Design guidelines as a
        reference, which we strive to follow where practical. The library
        doesn't necessarily implement the exact specs of every component or
        featureâ€”where official guidelines are incomplete or contradictory,
        maintainers apply common sense along with the latest standards in web
        development.
